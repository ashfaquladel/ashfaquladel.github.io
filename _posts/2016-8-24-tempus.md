Abstract:
Contemporary progress in satellite imaging and computer vision technology has made it feasible to make automatic weather predictions accurately. To reduce environmental damages and limit the risk of human lives, we have introduced a system to predict cyclones from satellite imagery. The eye of a powerful cyclone inherits a lot of information about its behavior, indicating that detecting the cyclone’s center rotating area is also an important task; we have constructed a deep learning object detection system to locate a cyclone’s eye. Several models using machine learning and deep learning approaches have produced a cyclone prediction accuracy, ranging from 86 to 95% or better and cyclone eye detection accuracy over 87%. Our experiment’s results have been impressive, highlighting that it can outperform conventional approaches and existing works.
